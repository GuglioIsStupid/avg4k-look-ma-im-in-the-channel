To create a modchart, go into a chart and add a folder called "mod". 

Create a file called "mod.lua" and paste in this template:

"

function create()

end

"

Not going to teach you how to use lua but if you already know the stuff you can do is pretty simple.

(function)

activateMod(modName,beat,beatLength,easingType,amount)

is what activates most mods, the list of mods (currently) are:

drunk, tipsy, dizzy, amovex, amovey, aconfusion

https://craftedcart.gitlab.io/notitg_docs/modifiers.html to figure out what they do.

For column specific mods use

(function)

activateModMap(modName,beat,beatLength,easingType,amount, col)

same thing but different mods,

those are: reverse, confusion, movex, movey

That is basically it (for now), you can look at https://pastebin.com/sGB5T97k for an example.

planning on support for sprites and more mods later, but right now it's still pretty alright.
