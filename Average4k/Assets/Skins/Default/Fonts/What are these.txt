Hi!

You might be a little confused on what these are, and well that's okay.

These are sprite fonts, after taking in account vector fonts. I think it's better to have the speed of sprite fonts instead of the scalability of vectors,

so thus we are now using sprite fonts.


How do I make them?

Well I made them by using http://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/ (which is awesome btw)

I also added the config I used inside of this folder. If you want to know how to use this program, look it up. its not that hard.

But if you're having trouble, join our discord and ask for help.
