Andale, Arial, ArialBold, FuturaBold are all non unicode. Basically they don't support japanese characters.

ArialUnicode is obviously one that contains japanese and korean characters along with latin.

HaiseiBold is basically futura with some small changes, but it has japanese characters. (it does not contain korean characters though)
